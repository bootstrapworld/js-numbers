The bignum implementation (content from jsbn.js and jsbn2.js) is from
Tom Wu's JSBN library at:

WARNING WARNING

This is nowhere near good documentation yet, or good test cases for
that matter.  I'm still migrating content and tests over from the
Moby-scheme project.  Use at your own risk.

TODO

* Absorb implementations of:

  atan2, cosh, sinh, makePolar, makeRectangular, quotient, remainder,
  sgn

* Bring over the numeric test cases from Moby.

* Add real documentation.

* Integrate regular, unboxed fixnums.

* Integrate bignums.

    - There are two bignum libraries to look into:

    jbsn:  http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/
    BigInteger: http://silentmatt.com/biginteger/



* Add js minimization build process.  Use google closure to do it
   aggressively.


* Find out: what is the implementation mentioned in:

Deniz A. Gursel, Ugur Cekmez, R. Emre Basar.  "Implementation of
Scheme Numeric System for JavaScript"

I suspect it's worldwithweb, but it's hard to find.
