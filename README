WARNING WARNING

This is nowhere near good documentation yet.  I'm still migrating
content and tests over from the Moby-scheme project.  Use at your own
risk.

TODO

* Absorb implementations of:

  atan2, cosh, sinh, makePolar, makeRectangular, quotient, remainder,
  sgn

* Bring over the numeric test cases from Moby.

* Add real documentation.

* Integrate regular, unboxed fixnums.

* Integrate bignums.

* Add js minimization build process.  Use google closure to do it
   aggressively.


* Find out: what is the implementation mentioned in:

Deniz A. Gursel, Ugur Cekmez, R. Emre Basar.  "Implementation of
Scheme Numeric System for JavaScript"
http://ab.org.tr/ab10/bildiri/161.pdf

I suspect it's worldwithweb, but it's hard to find.
